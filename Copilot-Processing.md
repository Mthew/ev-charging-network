## Current Summary

Successfully resolved the hydration error by fixing HTML structure:

### ‚úÖ Issue Resolved:

**Problem**: The `<Skeleton>` component (which renders as a `<div>`) was being placed inside a `<p>` element, which is invalid HTML and causes hydration errors.

**Solution**: Changed the `<p>` element to a `<div>` element while maintaining the same styling classes.

### üîß Technical Fix:

- **Before**: `<p className="text-sm text-gray-500">` containing `<Skeleton>` div elements
- **After**: `<div className="text-sm text-gray-500">` containing `<Skeleton>` div elements

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

- **Valid HTML Structure** - Follows proper semantic HTML rules
- **No Hydration Errors** - Eliminates React hydration mismatches
- **Preserved Styling** - Maintains identical visual appearance
- **Same Functionality** - All existing behavior preserved

The fix ensures that the skeleton loading states work correctly without causing HTML validation or hydration issues.
